## 1.1. Lab's Objective

> - Solve efficiently a generic `n2-1 puzzle` (also known as Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Mystic Square, etc.) using path-search algorithms
> - Cost: the total number of actions evaluated

## 1.2. The problem

> *Given a `n2-1 puzzle`, starting from a shuffled position, go back to un-shuffled solution with the `shortest path`.*

## 1.3. Strategy [WIP]

I'm trying to implement an A*-Pathfinding as shown in [Implementing A-star(A*) to solve N-Puzzle](https://algorithmsinsight.wordpress.com/graph-theory-2/a-star-in-general/implementing-a-star-to-solve-n-puzzle/).
